# ðŸ’¤ Fatigue State Classifier

This project builds a machine learning classifier to detect whether a person is in a rest or fatigue state based on physiological signals (e.g., heart rate, EMG, IR).

## This notebook demonstrates:

-Loading and preprocessing biosignal data

-Feature selection and normalization

-Training machine learning classifiers

-Evaluating model performance

# Dataset Contains columns such as:

IR â†’ Infrared sensor readings

bpm / avgBPM â†’ Heart rate and average beats per minute

EMG â†’ Electromyography signal

state â†’ Target variable (Rest / Fatigue)

## ðŸ“Š Example Use Cases

- Detect fatigue in drivers to prevent accidents

- Monitor athlete fatigue during training

- Early health monitoring in medical applications

# Tech Stack

* Python

* pandas / NumPy â†’ data handling

* matplotlib / seaborn â†’ data visualization

* scikit-learn â†’ ML models and evaluation
